Explain any adjustments
```
A. I have adjust Reserved OS Memory from 10% of all memory (12.8GB) to 24GB
```

What criteria affects workload factor? What does a value of 1, 2, or 4 signify?
```
I have a workload from ETL inject large data from text file to hdfs, sqoop injest data form RDBMS 
and spark streaming injest data form web application. So the value of workload factor is 3.
